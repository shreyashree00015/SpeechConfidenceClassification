# Speech Confidence Classification

This repository contains a speech confidence classification pipeline. The pipeline includes feature extraction from audio, clustering based on confidence, and building a BiLSTM, CNN and RNN neural network model for classification. The aim is to classify audio segments based on their confidence levels, aiding in the analysis and processing of speech data.
